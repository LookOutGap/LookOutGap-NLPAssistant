It combines several existing open-source libraries such as pandas, spaCy, and scikit-learn to make a pipeline ready to process text data. There are many user-defined parameters depending on your type of project such as the ability to choose stemming or lemmatization. Or, you might want to define explicitly what to substitute with NaN text fields. Overall, it is a way to get you started in your NLP task, no matter what you need.\n\nA tutorial on how to use this package can be found [here](tutorial.ipynb).\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n   - U
